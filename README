The Hilbert kernel library is intended to provide a core library for formal
proof verification.

At this point, the library is not yet finished (i.e., not even in alpha
stage). You are encouraged to contribute! Just drop me a note on
wikiproofs.org (user GrafZahl) or github.com (TheCount).

Some starting points:

* COPYING
  contains the license under which this software is distributed.

* BUILD
  for instructions on how to build and install the software.

* You may also want to check out the following places to get the hang of
  formal proof verification:
    - http://www.wikiproofs.org
      A site dedicated to collaborative theorem proving with formal
      verification.
    - https://sites.google.com/a/ghilbert.org/ghilbert/
      Raph Levien's Ghilbert, from which the hilbert kernel library was
      inspired.
    - http://us.metamath.org
      Norman Megill's metamath site, with thousands of formally verified
      proofs.
